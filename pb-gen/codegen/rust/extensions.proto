// Note: While proto3 still supports extensions for custom fields (https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/1460)
// it does not support default values. Unfortunately the OneOfOptions::nullable field has a default value of true, while
// in proto3 booleans have a default value of false. We can't migrate this file to proto3 without deprecating nullable
// and changing its semantics. gogoproto extensions still use proto2 as well (https://github.com/gogo/protobuf/blob/master/gogoproto/gogo.proto)
